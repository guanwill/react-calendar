# calreact

This is a simple calendar appointments app via [Learnetto](https://learnetto.com).

It's a Ruby on Rails 5 app which uses React.js on the frontend.

This branch introduces the separation of Rails and React. Now, this repo, this branch, only serves Restful API for appointments and uses Devise Token Auth for authentication to set up auth endpoints.
Frontend is now a separate app.
